## How to use frontend? 

Because `/knowledge-extraction/build-graph` is accessible only for autorized users, consider disabling `[Autorize]` attribute in `src/Web/Controllers/GraphBuildingController.cs` in this endpoint in code first (comment it) and then you can use frontend. Yes, it is not convinient, but frontend *was not* a part of the project and provided as extra.
