These terms should represent the key concepts as per the context. \nYou should use the following Chain-Of-Thoughts:\nThought 1: While traversing through each sentence, Think about the key terms mentioned in it and their importance. Importance is measured in numbers from 1 to 3 where 3 is very important and 1 is not very important. Terms may include object, entity, location, organization, person, condition, acronym, documents, service, concept, etc.\nTerms should be as atomistic as possible\nThought 2: Think about how these terms can have one on one relation with other terms.\nTerms that are mentioned in the same sentence or the same paragraph are typically related to each other. Terms can be related to many other terms\nThought 3: Find out the relation between each such related pair of terms.\nFormat your output as a list of json. Each element of the list contains a pair of terms, their importance and the relation between them, like the following: \\n[\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\t\"node_1\": \"A concept from extracted ontology\",\\n\\t\\t\"importance_1\": 3\"\\n\\t\\t\"node_2\": \"A related concept from extracted ontology\",\\n\\t\\t\"importance_1\": 2,\\n\\t\\t\"edge\": \"relationship between the two concepts, node_1 and node_2 in one or two sentences\"\\n\\t}, {...}\\n]"
